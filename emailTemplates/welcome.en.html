		<h1>Welcome to TypesafeCon! </h1>
		<p>Thank you for trying out the TypesafeCon app.</p>
		<p>As you may know, we have released the TypesafeCon components as Open Source projects, and we would
			love to get your feedback. Even better, if you'd like to play with the code, and contribute to it, 
			it's as easy as 1-2-3:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Fork the application repository <a href="https://github.com/tindr/TypesafeCon">here</a>.</li>
			<li>Hack away at the source code.</li>
			<li>Send us a pull request, and we'll include your changes if they're safe and fun for everyone :)</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Have fun, and enjoy the conference!</p>
		<p>The Typesafe Team</p>
