			it's as easy as 1-2-3:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Fork the application repository <a href="https://github.com/tindr/Scala1">here</a>.</li>
			<li>Hack away at the source code.</li>
			<li>Send us a pull request, and we'll include your changes if they're safe and fun for everyone :)</li>
		</ol>

		<p>You can also take a look at the 
			<a href="https://github.com/magneticbear/scalaone_iphone">iOS</a> and 
			<a href="https://github.com/magneticbear/scala1_android">Android</a>
